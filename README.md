# GLOFsusceptibility

This repository contains the source codes to model the probability of a glacier lake having a GLOF history. A mandatory prerequisite to run the scripts is to install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio (https://rstudio.com) on your machine. The comments within the scripts provide further details on model dependencies and usage of functions.
